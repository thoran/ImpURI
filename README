ImpURI

Description
===========

This is a hand-written non-validating parser for URI's and ssh/scp almost URI resource descriptors which is intended to be cleaner and simpler than Ruby's standard URI.  


Raison d'etre
=============

I wrote for two reasons... 

1. Ruby's standard URI library doesn't handle ssh/scp resource descriptors, which are the near-to, not quite URI, but commonly used, ssh/scp way of describing a network addressable resource: username:password@host:/path.  URI's have a scheme at the start, and the path begins with only a forward slash, whereas an ssh/scp resource has no scheme, and the path begins with a colon and a slash.  I wanted to be able to handle both.  

2. Ruby's standard URI class does too much.  It is overblown and untidy.  I just want it to break the strings down and that's it.  I don't want any scheme interpolation from the port number, nor from the host name, or any other 'smarts'.  


Examples
========

uri = ImpURI.parse('scheme://user:pass@hostname.domain.name:20/path/to/resource?q=param')
=> an object of class ImpURI

uri.scheme OR uri.protocol
=> 'scheme'

uri.userinfo OR uri.credentials OR uri.user_info OR uri.username_and_password
=> 'user:pass'

uri.user OR uri.username
=> 'user'

uri.pass OR uri.passwd OR uri.password
=> 'pass'

uri.host OR uri.hostname
=> 'hostname.domain.name'

uri.port OR uri.portnumber OR uri.port_number
=> '20'

uri.path
=> '/path/to/resource'

uri.parameter_string
=> 'q=param'

uri.parameters
=> {q => param}
